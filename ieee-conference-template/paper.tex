% 2) Provide a fake natbib command \NAT@parse so that hyperref will not
%    interfere with the operation of cite.sty. However, as a result citation
%    numbers will not be hyperlinked. Also, natbib will not be able to work
%    with IEEEtran. However, this is perhaps the best solution until cite.sty
%    and hyperref.sty are able to co-exist with each other.
%    It easy enough to override the fake command via:
\makeatletter
\let\NAT@parse\undefined
\makeatother

%\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}  % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.

                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
